# Security Guidelines for Terminalizer

This document outlines security best practices and guidelines for contributing to and using Terminalizer.

## Input Validation

### File Path Validation
- All file paths are validated and resolved to prevent path traversal attacks
- Invalid characters in filenames are rejected
- Path length limits are enforced

### Command Sanitization
- User-provided commands are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Shell metacharacters are filtered in custom commands
- Command validation is performed before execution

### Configuration Validation
- All configuration parameters are validated for type and range
- Malformed configurations are rejected with clear error messages
- Default values are provided for missing parameters

## Dependency Management

### Regular Security Audits
- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies promptly when security fixes are available
- Monitor security advisories for used packages

### Dependency Minimization
- Only include necessary dependencies
- Regularly review and remove unused dependencies
- Consider alternatives for heavy dependencies

## Runtime Security

### Process Isolation
- Terminal sessions are properly isolated
- Temporary files are cleaned up after use
- Process permissions are minimal

### Error Handling
- Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- Stack traces are only shown in development mode
- Graceful error handling prevents crashes

## Code Security

### Safe Coding Practices
- No use of `eval()` or similar dangerous functions
- Proper input sanitization
- Safe file operations with proper error handling

### Debugging
- No debug statements in production code
- Sensitive data is not logged
- Development-only code is properly gated

## User Guidelines

### Safe Usage
- Be cautious when recording terminals with sensitive information
- Review recordings before sharing
- Use strong, unique passwords for online accounts

### Privacy Considerations
- Recordings may contain sensitive information
- Consider what is visible in your terminal before recording
- Be aware of environment variables that might be exposed

1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. Send a detailed report to the maintainers privately
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure
